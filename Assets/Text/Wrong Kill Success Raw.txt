ENDING CUTSCENE - WRONG KILL, GOT AWAY 

YOU
(door opens) honey, i’m home! 

ALICE
you went grocery shopping without me? 

YOU
you’ve been a little tired, lately. i just wanted to help out a little, love. 

ALICE
thanks, sweetheart. grocery shopping with you is hardly a chore, though. 

YOU
i just thought you could use the rest. how have things been going at work lately? 

ALICE
not great, dear. 

ALICE
even after what happened with [suspect]…. 

ALICE
we’ve only been getting busier. the company’s really desperate for some good PR, and we’ve got a lot of work to catch up on. 

YOU
love….

ALICE
yes, i know. 

ALICE
don’t worry about me, dear. i’ve got it handled. 

YOU 
is there anything i can do to help?

ALICE
i’m afraid not, sweetheart. 

ALICE
hey, don’t wait up, okay? i’ve got some work to do, and i refuse to be the one to keep you up. 

ALICE
there’s no sense in the both of us being too tired to function, yeah?

YOU
alice—

ALICE
no buts! 

ALICE
go to bed, love. goodnight. 

YOU
sweet dreams.
