(door opens) Honey, I—
Get out. 
GET OUT. 
What were you thinking?
What were you trying to do? 
Did you think you could just come home to me like it never happened? 
Did you think I wouldn’t notice?
Sweetheart—
Don’t you sweetheart me! 
You tried to kill me! 
I loved you! I—
I—
Get out. 
Get out. I don’t want to hear a word from you. 
(turning away) I don’t want to see you. 
Just— 
Get out. Please.
