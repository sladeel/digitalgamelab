(door opens) Honey, I'm home!
(upset) Where were you?
I can explain.
I'm not going to listen to your excuses.
I'm not going to listen to your excuses. I don't- how could you?
Alice-
What is wrong with you?
I can explain-
What is there to explain?
I mean- Yes, she might not have been the nicest, but-
That doesn't mean I wanted you to kill her!
How could you do that?
How could you just kill someone like that?
You don't understand. She was going behind your back and-
She was going behind my back?
She was going behind my back? What the hell are you-
Don't you get it?
Don't you get it? <i>You're the one whose been going behind my back!</i>
I didn't ask you to kill her.
I didn't ask you to kill her. I didn't ask you to kill anyone!
What is wrong with you? How could that be your immediate conclusion?
(mimicking) Oh, people have been bothering my wife at work so my first instict is to <i> hunt them down and murder them?</i>
Sweetheart-
No.
I don't want to look at you.
(turning away)(quietly) I don't know who you are anymore.
