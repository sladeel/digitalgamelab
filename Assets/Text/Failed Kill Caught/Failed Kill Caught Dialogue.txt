(door opens) Honey, I'm home!
(upset) Where were you?
I can explain.
I'm not going to listen to your excuses.
I'm not going to listen to your excuses. I don't- how could you?
Alice-
What is wrong with you?
I can explain-
What is there to explain?
You tried to kill someone!
I mean- Yes, [subject] might not have been the nicest, but-
That doesn't mean I wanted you to kill [object]!
How could you do that?
How could you just kill someone like that?
You don't understand. I was trying to help you-
Help me?
Help me? I don't think you were thinking about <i>me</i> at all. 
I didn't ask you to try to kill [object].
I didn't ask you to try to kill [object]. I didn't ask you to try to kill anyone!
What is wrong with you? How could that be your immediate conclusion?
(mimicking) Oh, people have been bothering my wife at work so my first instict is to <i> hunt them down and murder them?</i>
Sweetheart-
No.
I don't want to look at you.
(turning away)(quietly) I don't know who you are anymore.
