(door opens) Honey, I'm home!
You went grocery shopping without me?
You've been a little tired, lately. I just wanted to help out a little, love.
Thanks, sweetheart. Grocery shopping with you is hardly a chore, though.
I just thought you could use the rest. How have things been going at work lately?
It feels terrible to say it, but- it's been getting a little better, yeah.
It feels terrible to say it, but- it's been getting a little better, yeah. After Chelsea...
I heard. It's a shame what happened to her.
Yeah. It was- 
Yeah. It was- horrible.
You don't need to talk about it, love. I know that it's been hard on you.
Yeah, well- the company's been letting up a bit since then, though.
I'm glad. Get some rest, dear, you deserve it, after all of this.
Yeah, I will. Thanks, sweetheart.
Anything for you, love.
