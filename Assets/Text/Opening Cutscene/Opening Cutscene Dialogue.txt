Hey, sweetheart. Ready for work?
(confused) It's- 7:30?
Mmmm. I know, I'm just kidding.
Your coffee's on the counter, okay?
Thanks, love.
Of course.
I need to be off, love. Those reports won't write themselves, yeah?
Have you got everything? Your lunch?
(confused) My lunch?
(realisation) Oh God, you're right. Thanks for the reminder, dear.
It's-
Hmm? 
No, don't tell me what it is, I want to be surprised.
Thanks for packing lunch for me, sweetheart. I'm looking forward to trying it.
Of course. Let me know if you like it, dear.
Hmm?
Hmm? Yes, I always do.
Hey, are you feeling alright, honey? You look a bit tired.
Tired? (teasing) No, I think you might need your eyes checked, sweetheart.
What, want to book an appointment for the weekend?
Sweetheart...
No, I just-
No, I just- didn't sleep well, is all.
No, I just- didn't sleep well, is all. Don't worry about me, dear. I'm fine, I promise.
Try again, love. I was there.
Okay, fine. You caught me.
(sigh) Things just haven't been going well lately.
I'm not really sure why, it just feels like-
I'm not really sure why, it just feels like- the world is conspiring to ruin my life.
Work's been piling up, management's been hounding me, things have been going missing, and-
(sigh) (wearily) Sorry, I didn't mean to get so mopey so early in the morning, dear.
I'm sure I'm just imagining things. I'll just power through it, yeah?
Love... You know you don't have to. You can tell me anything.
I'm sure, sweetheart. I can handle it.
If you're sure. I'm just worried, love.
Yes, I know. Thanks for thinking of me.
I'm always thinking of you.
(smiling) I know.
(kiss) Have a good day at work, dear.
You too. Tell me if you need anything, okay?
I'll be there. Drop of a hat. Anything at all.
(laughs) Yes, I know.
Love you.
I love you too.
