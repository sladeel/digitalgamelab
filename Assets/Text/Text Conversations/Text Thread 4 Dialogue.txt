promise you wont get angry at someone
not a strong opening
i may or may not be crying in the bathroom real quick
over lunch
oh no did you not like the noodles i made? i can never make them again
no no im sure they were delicious
i just didnt get to eat them
SOMEONE TOOK YOUR LUNCH AGAIN???
you promised you wouldnt get angry
actually you asked me to promise and then i didnt
:(
no one else gets their lunch stolen
with everything today it just feels like someones out to get me
my cooking is just that good, everyone wants it
sorry, probably not the time for jokes
its fine babe
i just wish i got to reap the rewards of marrying you 
god now im really crying
oh baby, are you okay? 
do you need to call?
do you want me to come pick you up early?
no no ill be fine
oh god robins come looking for me
is that a bad thing?
i just dont want them to talk them while im like this
at least its not david
David would come looking for you in the women's bathroom???
for taking a 60 minute lunch? absolutely
as if you arent on top of all your work and have plenty of time to spare
he needs to cut you some slack
maybe one day
uh oh i think robin saw my shoes its all over for me
talk to you later <3
love you <3
bye
