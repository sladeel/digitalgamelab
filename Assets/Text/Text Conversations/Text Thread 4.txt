Alice
Hey honey, heads up that I've got that work trip this weekend
You
Of course, thanks for the reminder
You
Do you want me to pack anything for you or have you got that sorted?
Alice
I should be okay, it's basically just going to be my work bag + clothes
You
When are you leaving again? Before or after work?
Alice
After
Alice
The flight's at 7:50pm so we'll head straight to the airport after work
You
It's another conference/convention thing, right?
Alice
Yeah, gotta listen to a bunch of old guys try tell me how to do my job
Alice
Though once we get to the convention floor it always gets a lot better
You
Who're you stuck with this time?
Alice
...Daniel
Alice
Even after the mess last week?
Alice
Daniel seems to have *conveniently forgotten* that whole mess after I finished my report 2 weeks early
You
Nice one, love, you show your boss who's boss
Alice
Tried a little too hard but I'll give it to you
You
You're too kind
