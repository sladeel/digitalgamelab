Alice
I'm coming home now
You
I thought you had the trip?
Alice
I have been replaced
You
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!
You
Do you want to call to talk about it?
Alice
I think I just want some quiet before I let it all out when I get home
Alice
Also I'm getting doughnuts and you can't stop me
You
Hahaha I wouldn't dare (doughnut)(heart)
You
See you soon, love
Alice
See you, honey (heart)
