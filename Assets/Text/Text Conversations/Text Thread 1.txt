Alice
Hey honey, I'm going to be late home tonight
Alice
Something came up again
You
Okay, love, do you want me to pick you up anything for you once you get home?
Alice
Honestly, just having dinner with you in front of the TV once I'm home should do the trick
Alice
I'm sorry for this, I know Friday nights are our nights, and I have been informed that this is the 'last time', but we both know that's probably the 10th time I've heard that
You
No stress, love
You
I'm sure things will get better
You
Btw I'm picking up icecream whether you like it or not :)
Alice
(Heart eyes)
Alice
You know how to make my day (heart)
