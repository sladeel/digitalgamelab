You
To interrupt your hopefully productive and relaxed day, how did you find the garlic chilli noodles? Were they too hot or just right ;)?
Alice
I'm sure they were delicious, honey
Alice
I just wish I got to eat them
You
WHAT!? Did someone take your lunch again? I labelled it so carefully!
Alice
I know you did, and it makes me so upset, and I swear nobody else's lunch gets taken
You
Maybe it's cos my cooking is just that good ;)
You
Sorry, probably not the time for jokes
Alice
No, honey, it's fine. Robin just came to check on me
You
Oh, love, are you okay? Do you want to call?
Alice
On my way home maybe
Alice
I've got to finish this limp salad from the canteen before Daniel glares at me for having a 61 minute lunch
You
Urgh, why does he even care when you absolutely ace all your assignments
Alice
He's got one serious stick up his ass, that's for sure
Alice
Gotta go, I can feel his eyes piercing the back of my skull
You
Alright, love, I'll have you know we still have some noodles and all the delicious seasonings in the cupboard, so I'll treat you tonight (heart)
Alice
Extra spicy please!
Alice
Have to burn this sad salad off my tongue
