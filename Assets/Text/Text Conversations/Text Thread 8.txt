Alice
I think I might take the day off tomorrow
Alice
I just had to redo all of Robin's work and I still have my report to finish up
Alice
So it's going to be another late one
You
Hasn't it been months now? Why can they get away with this so often when a single typo gets you a lecture?
You
I swear this isn't fair in the slightest
Alice
Maybe I shouldn't have started so strong here
Alice
The expectations now are insane
Alice
But Robin's still pretty young so I can't blame them for their lack of understanding
Alice
At least they're nice
You
At least they're not *Chad*
Alice
Omg don't even get me started
Alice
I'm definitely going to rant when I get home, so be ready for CHAOS
You
I'll brew the tea and restock the icecream :)
You
See you later, love (heart)
Alice
Love you!
You
Love you too!
