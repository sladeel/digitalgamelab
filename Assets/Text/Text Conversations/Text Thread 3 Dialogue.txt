omg i cannot catch a break today
oh no
someone posted a picture on friendzone from uni and tagged me in it
it was some party literally years ago
i guess they wanted to make it look like i was a party animal or something
but i only went to those parties to be chelseas ride home
ewwwww who posted it
i dunno it was some fake account
"Annie Moss"
AND daniel loves to stalk our social media accounts literally all the time
so i know hes going to see it and have a fit
was anyone else tagged in it?
no! it was just me!
you can barely tell who anyone is too
its like. targetted at me.
do you want me to see if i can get it taken down?
no no its okay love, i already reported it
wont stop daniel from seeing it though
is he really going to get mad for something you did in university
hes always on about our "image to possible clients" online
so yeah
i cant believe someone did this though
theyre probably just jealous of your shitty job and hot hot wife
so true babe <3
i have to go now, talk later
ok
love youuu <333
