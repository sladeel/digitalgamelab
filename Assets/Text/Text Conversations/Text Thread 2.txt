Omg I can't catch a break
You
Please tell me this isn't work related
Alice
Of course it's work related
Alice
Someone has posted a picture from Uni and tagged me in it
Alice
Picture of Wife and Chelsea amongst others on a couch in a dimly lit room with coloured lights. Everyone looks a little dishevelled like after a night out and at an after-party at home.
Alice
I wasn't even drunk
Alice
I was the DD
Alice
And they also tagged my work
You
You're kidding me
Alice
And Daniel follows me and stalks our social media accounts literally all the time
Alice
He's going to have a fit about this
You
Why would someone even do that? That was years ago
Alice
I don't even know
You
Why does it even matter? You were, what, 19? Who even cares?
Alice
Daniel does, cos apparently it 'could ruin client views of our company and its employees'
You
Can you get it taken down? Or do you want me to handle it?
Alice
It's okay, honey, I think I'd better do it since it's me in the photo
Alice
And my work and such
You
Once you report it, you'd better enjoy the rest of your trip.
You
Speaking of, aren't a few of the others in that photo with you rn? Are their work's tagged?
Alice
No, just mine apparently
Alice
Maybe someone's out to get meeee
You
Ooooh maybe
You
What kind of scandal have you got yourself involved in?
Alice
Being in a happy and loving relationship with a relatively stable jooooob ooooh
You
Scandalous
You
Absolutely scandalous
Alice
You know me (wink)
Alice
Talk later, honey, Lizzy made waffles (waffle emoji)
You
Enjoy, love!
You
See you tomorrow night (heart)
Alice
See you then (heart)
