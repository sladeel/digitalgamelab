Hey, honey. Welcome home.
Hey, love. You okay?

It's just... getting to me, you know?
It's just... getting to me, you know? It really feels like someone's trying to ruin my life.
Work again? Or something else?
I really don't know. Both, maybe.
<i>She puts her head in her hands.</i>
It's just so tiring. With everything going on, I just want it to stop, but I've tried everything. 
It feels like sabotage or something else malicious.
Is there someone or something that pushed it over the edge today?
Just more of everything. Stress at work, irritating people, no lunch. And another HR meeting to top it off.
Is there anything I can do for you about this?
Don't worry about it, honey. I can handle it. Just a hug, maybe.

<i>I need to fix this. I need to remove the issue.</i>
