ENDING CUTSCENE - WRONG KILL, CAUGHT

YOU
(door opens) honey, i’m home! 

ALICE
(upset) where were you?

YOU
i can explain. 

ALICE
i’m not going to listen to your excuses. i don’t— how could you?

YOU
alice—

ALICE
what is wrong with you?? 

YOU
i can explain— 

ALICE 
what is there to explain? 

ALICE
i mean— yes, [she/he/they] might not have been the nicest, but— 

ALICE
that doesn’t mean i wanted you to kill [her/him/them]! 

ALICE 
how could you do that? 

ALICE
how could you just kill someone like that? 

YOU
you don't understand. i was trying to help you— 

ALICE
help me? i don't think you were thinking about me at all.

ALICE
i didn’t ask you to kill [her/him/them]. i didn’t ask you to kill anyone! 

ALICE
what is wrong with you? how could that be your immediate conclusion? 

ALICE
(mimicking) oh, people have been bothering my wife at work so my first instinct is to (incredulous) hunt them down and murder them? 

YOU
sweetheart—

ALICE
no. 

ALICE
i don’t want to look at you.

ALICE
(turning away) (quietly) i don’t know who you are anymore.
