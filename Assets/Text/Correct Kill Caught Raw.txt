ALICE

YOU

ALICE 
what is there to explain?

ALICE
i mean— yes, she might not have been the nicest, but— 

ALICE
that doesn’t mean i wanted you to kill her! 

ALICE 
how could you do that? 

ALICE
how could you just kill someone like that? 

YOU
you don’t understand. she was going behind your back and—

ALICE
she was going behind my back? what the hell are you— don’t you get it? (angry) YOU’RE the one whose been going behind my back! 

ALICE
i didn’t ask you to kill her. i didn’t ask you to kill anyone! 

ALICE

ALICE
(mimicking) oh, people have been bothering my wife at work so my first instinct is to (incredulous) hunt them down and murder them? 

YOU

ALICE

ALICE
i don’t want to look at you.

ALICE
(turning away) (quietly) i don’t know who you are anymore.
