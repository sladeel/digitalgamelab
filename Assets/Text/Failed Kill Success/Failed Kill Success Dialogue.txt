(door opens) Honey, I'm home!
You went grocery shopping without me?
You've been a little tired, lately. I just wanted to help out a little, love.
Thanks, sweetheart. Grocery shopping with you is hardly a chore, though.
I just thought you could use the rest. How have things been going at work lately?
Well, I mean- nothing's changed really.
Don't look at me like that, I'm fine. 
Don't look at me like that, I'm fine. Really.
Love...
Yes, I know.
Don't worry about me, dear. I've got it handled.
Is there anything I can do to help?
I'm afraid not, sweetheart.
Hey, don't wait up, okay?
I've got some work to do, and I refuse to be the one to keep you up.
There's no sense in the both of us being too tired to function, yeah?
Alice-
No buts!
Go to bed, love. Goodnight.
Sweet dreams.
