ALICE
(sigh) things just haven’t been going well lately. i’m not really sure why, it just feels like— the world is conspiring to ruin my life. 

ALICE
work’s been piling up, management’s been hounding me, things have been going missing, and—

ALICE
(sigh) (wearily) sorry, i didn’t mean to get so mopey so early in the morning, dear. 

ALICE
i’m sure i’m just imagining things. i’ll just power through it, yeah? 

YOU
